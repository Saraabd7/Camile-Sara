Jenkins ðŸ’» ðŸ”¥

- EVERYTHING NEW (new Github, new job on Jenkins)
- Check README and put each criteria here:
- Create Dev branch:
- Merge the Dev branch code with the master branch and test
- Github plugin to set the commit status on Github for the latest commit
- Git publisher plugin to push the master branch to Github if the tests pass
* As a developer, when i push my developer branch dev-feature2 to origin it triggers the pipeline. It tests the code and if successful: it merges the to master and notifies the developer, else it just notifies the developer!!
